//! iGui — integrated GUI for NewCormanLisp.
//!
//! Direct-rendered MDI frame using Direct2D and DirectWrite. Borrowed
//! from the sister NewCP repo (E:/NewCP/NewCP/src/newcp-runtime/src/
//! igui) — the renderer architecture and event-mailbox design carry
//! over verbatim. The integration layer (`cp_exports.rs`) is what
//! changed: NewCP routed these via its CP module system, here we
//! install them as native Lisp functions through the same
//! `install_native` mechanism format and the file primitives use.
//!
//! Architecture:
//!   - `window` runs an MDI frame on a dedicated GUI thread.
//!   - `child` manages MDI children; each child owns a render
//!     surface (D3D swap chain wrapped by D2D).
//!   - `channels` is a bounded MPSC mailbox carrying typed
//!     `IGuiEvent` values from the GUI thread to the language
//!     thread.
//!   - `batch` queues `SurfaceCmd` draw operations for execution by
//!     `executor` on the GUI thread.
//!   - `ledit` and `log_view` are built-in MDI children for an
//!     editor and a log overlay; `tools_menu` wires their menu and
//!     accelerators into the frame.
//!
//! Phase 1 scope: open an MDI frame + MDI client, initialize D3D11 /
//! Direct2D / DirectWrite, paint a solid color into the MDI client
//! area during `WM_PAINT`, and exit cleanly on `WM_CLOSE` /
//! `WM_DESTROY`. The Lisp-side bindings (NEXT-EVENT / OPEN-CHILD /
//! ...) ride on top in a follow-up commit.
